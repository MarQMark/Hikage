# Description
a tool to view fragment shaders. It provides a project system in addition to support for textures.
Also, due to the support of python scripts, its functionality can be greatly increased (e.g. making a 3D camera controller)

# Build
Only tested for Linux, but most functionality *should* work on Windows as well.

The project can be built using CMake, but a precompiled executable is provided under Releases.

# Examples
Two example projects are provided under examples:

- GravLensing: A showcase of gravitational lensing from a black hole. The python script has to be activated in order to be able to move the camera with SADW (In order to for the planets to work the appropriate textures have to be added manually)
- Sunset: A sunset with moving trees at the bottom.
